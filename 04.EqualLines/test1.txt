Load up on guns, bring your friends 
It's fun to lose and to pretend 
She's overboard and self-assured 
Oh, no, I know a dirty word 

Hello, Hello, Hello, How Low (x3) 
Hello, Hello, Hello 

With the lights out, it's less dangerous 
Here we are now, entertain us 
I feel stupid and contagious 
Here we are now, entertain us 

A mulatto 
An albino 
A mosquito 
My libido 
Yeah 

Hey... Yay 

I'm worse at what I do best 
And for this gift I feel blessed 
Our little group (tribe) has always been 
And always will until the end 

Hello, Hello, Hello, How Low (x3) 
Hello, Hello, Hello 

With the lights out, it's less dangerous 
Here we are now, entertain us 
I feel stupid and contagious 
Here we are now, entertain us 

A mulatto 
An albino 
A mosquito 
My libido 
Yeah 

Hey... Yay 

(Guitar solo) 

And I forget just why I taste 
Oh, yeah, I guess it makes me smile 
I found it hard, it's hard to find 
Oh well, whatever, nevermind 

Hello, Hello, Hello, How Low (x3) 
Hello, Hello, Hello 

With the lights out, it's less dangerous 
Here we are now, entertain us 
I feel stupid and contagious 
Here we are now, entertain us 

A mulatto 
An albino 
A mosquito 
My libido 

Yeah a denial 
A denial! (x9)
